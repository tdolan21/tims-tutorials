# Speculative Decoding leads to a 47% improvement in Whisper's performance

## Abstract 

This blog post delves into the groundbreaking advancement in automatic speech recognition (ASR) using OpenAI's Whisper model enhanced by Speculative Decoding. Speculative Decoding, a technique employing a smaller, assistant model, has been shown to significantly improve the performance and efficiency of the larger Whisper model. Our experiment uses the openai/whisper-large-v2 as the base model and distil-whisper/distil-large-v2 as the assistant model. Conducted on two distinct audio file lengths, the results showcase the remarkable efficiency gains, with Speculative Decoding combined with Flash Attention 2 offering a 47.91% improvement in processing speed for shorter audio files. This post provides comprehensive insight into the methodology, experimental setup, and implications of these findings for the future of ASR technology.

## Introduction
In the realm of automatic speech recognition (ASR), OpenAI's Whisper model represents a significant advancement. However, even the most advanced models can face challenges in terms of performance and speed. This is where Speculative Decoding comes into play, offering a novel approach to enhancing the performance of Whisper.

Speculative Decoding is a technique that allows larger models to see potential performance gains
by utilizing a smaller model in parallel. The smaller model acts as a draft, or "assistant", model, and
predicts the next token in the sequence. The larger model then uses the assistant's predicted token as the next token
in th sequence. 

## Process of Events

1. The draft model predicts a sequence of tokens that may come next.
2. The target model estimates the probability of the next token.
3. The target model "approves" the estimate of the draft token assuming the probability meets the
desired output of the target models parameters.
4. If the probability is too low, the target model will reject the draft token and predict the next token itself.
5. The final token signifying the End of Sequence is selected from the target model.
6. The tokens selected from the draft model are concatenated with the final token from the target model to form the final output.

## Experiment

The purpose of this experiment is to see if Speculative Decoding can improve the performance of Whisper in various conditions.

The base model used is `openai/whisper-large-v2`. The draft model used is `distil-whisper/distil-large-v2`.

The model from disitl-whisper is 49% smaller than the base model and 6 times faster (Gandhi, von Platen, Rush, 2023).

The experiment was run on a single nvidia 4090 GPU with 24GB of VRAM.

## Process

The experiment was run on two different audio files, one short and one long.

Each test was ran 5 times and the average completion time were recorded.

The files consisted of a 2m30s audio file and a 1h16m audio file and were chosen because they represent different sides of the usage spectrum.

This helps to determine if Speculative Decoding can improve performance in both short and long audio files.

## Control

This was the code used to achieve the control results.

```python
# Function to load and resample an audio file
def load_and_resample_audio(file_path, target_sample_rate=16000):
    audio, _ = librosa.load(file_path, sr=target_sample_rate)
    return {"array": audio, "sampling_rate": target_sample_rate}

# Set device and data type for PyTorch
device = "cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
torch_dtype = torch.float16 if torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.float32

# Load the speech recognition model
model_id = "openai/whisper-large-v2"
model = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained(
    model_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, low_cpu_mem_usage=True, use_safetensors=True, use_flash_attention_2=True
)
model.to(device)

# Load the processor
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)


pipe = pipeline(
    "automatic-speech-recognition",
    model=model,
    feature_extractor=processor.feature_extractor,
    max_new_tokens=128,
    tokenizer=processor.tokenizer,
    torch_dtype=torch_dtype,
    device=device,
)

# Specify the path to your audio file here
audio_file_path = 'audio/audio-file.mp3'

# Load and resample the audio file
audio_data = load_and_resample_audio(audio_file_path)

# Measure the time taken for speech recognition
start_time = time.time()
result = pipe(audio_data)
end_time = time.time()

# Calculate and print the time taken
time_taken = end_time - start_time
print(f"Time to completion: {time_taken:.2f} seconds")
print(result["text"])
```
and this was the script used to test the speculative decoding methods.

```python

import time

# Function to load and resample an audio file
def load_and_resample_audio(file_path, target_sample_rate=16000):
    audio, _ = librosa.load(file_path, sr=target_sample_rate)
    return {"array": audio, "sampling_rate": target_sample_rate}

# Set device and data type for PyTorch
device = "cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
torch_dtype = torch.float16 if torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.float32

# Load the assistant model
assistant_model_id = "distil-whisper/distil-large-v2"
assistant_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    assistant_model_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, low_cpu_mem_usage=True, use_safetensors=True,
)
assistant_model.to(device)

# Load the speech recognition model
model_id = "openai/whisper-large-v2"
model = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained(
    model_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, low_cpu_mem_usage=True, use_safetensors=True,
)
model.to(device)

# Load the processor
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)

# Initialize the pipeline
pipe = pipeline(
    "automatic-speech-recognition",
    model=model,
    tokenizer=processor.tokenizer,
    feature_extractor=processor.feature_extractor,
    max_new_tokens=128,
    generate_kwargs={"assistant_model": assistant_model},
    torch_dtype=torch_dtype,
    device=device,
)

# Specify the path to your audio file here
audio_file_path = 'audio/audio-file.mp3'

# Load and resample the audio file
audio_data = load_and_resample_audio(audio_file_path)

# Measure the time taken for speech recognition
start_time = time.time()
result = pipe(audio_data)
end_time = time.time()

# Calculate and print the time taken
time_taken = end_time - start_time
print(f"Time to completion: {time_taken:.2f} seconds")
print(result["text"])
```
